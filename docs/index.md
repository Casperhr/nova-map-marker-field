## Supporting This Package
This is an MIT-licensed open source project with its ongoing development made possible by the support of the community. If you'd like to support this, and our other packages, please consider [becoming a backer or sponsor on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/mikebronner).

## Commitment to Quality
During package development I try as best as possible to embrace good design and development practices, to help ensure that this package is as good as it can
be. My checklist for package development includes:

-   ✅ Achieve as close to 100% code coverage as possible using unit tests.
-   ✅ Eliminate any issues identified by SensioLabs Insight and Scrutinizer.
-   ✅ Be fully PSR1, PSR2, and PSR4 compliant.
-   ✅ Include comprehensive documentation in README.md.
-   ✅ Provide an up-to-date CHANGELOG.md which adheres to the format outlined
    at <http://keepachangelog.com>.
-   ✅ Have no PHPMD or PHPCS warnings throughout all code.

## If you ❤️ open-source software, give the repos you use a ⭐️.
We have included the awesome `symfony/thanks` composer package as a dev dependency. Let your OS package maintainers know you appreciate them by starring the packages you use. Simply run composer thanks after installing this package. (And not to worry, since it's a dev-dependency it won't be installed in your live environment.)
